placecage
=========

placecage is a Drupal 7 module that extends the dummyimage module found here:
https://drupal.org/project/dummyimage

Install the module like you would any other by placing the file in something like:
sites/all/modules/placecage

My local dev sites don't quite seem complete with pictures of kittens or bacon so I added a little Nick Cage action!

Enjoy!
